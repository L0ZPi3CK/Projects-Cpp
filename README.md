- ',' as a operator
- Comparison operators: >, >=, ==, <=, <, and !=
- While loop
- The typedef statement
- Do while loop
- Get() method

- Nested loops and two-dimensional arrays

Section 6 - Conditional Statements and Logical Operations
- If statement
- If else statement
- Logical operators &&, ||, !
